What should be done:
- save last data locally (replace included in project forecast.json which will be used by LocalForecastDataProvider)
- use a LocalForecastDataProvider in case if LiveForecastDataProvider returns .failure
- unit test for all current models calculated variables;
- remove Seques and use in code transition;
- create AppCoordinator which should manage all necessary transactions;
- automation UI test;
- add swift-lint call to prebuild step with special rules;
